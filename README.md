# Road Accident Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to uncover insights about accident outcomes, causes, and contributing factors. Using interactive visualizations created in Power BI, the project explores relationships between variables such as road features, weather conditions, and accident outcomes.

## Features
- **Interactive Bar Charts**: Visualize accident causes and outcomes categorized by road features, weather, traffic controls, and more.
- **Donut Chart Analysis**: Showcase the distribution of accident outcomes, including minor injuries, grievous injuries, total injuries, and fatalities.
- **Deep Dive**: Analyze sub-causes and their impact on accident outcomes.
- **Data Insights**: Understand key trends and factors contributing to road accidents.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For creating and visualizing interactive charts.
- **CSV Dataset**: Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Data (India, 2020).

## Visualizations
1. **Bar Chart**: Accidents categorized by cause and outcome.
2. **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Sub-categories of causes linked to accident outcomes.
3. **Donut Chart**: Proportional representation of accident outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about road accidents, including columns:
- **Cause and Sub-cause**: Factors leading to accidents (e.g., road features, weather, traffic violations).
- **Outcome of Incident**: Categories such as grievous injuries, minor injuries, fatalities, etc.
- **Count**: Number of accidents corresponding to each category.

## Key Findings
- **Weather and Road Conditions**: Clear weather and straight roads contribute significantly to accidents.
- **Major Causes**: Traffic violations and road features are leading causes of fatal accidents.
- **Sub-Cause Analysis**: Two-wheelers and pedestrian-related accidents show high injury rates.

## How to Use
1. Open the Power BI file provided in the repository.
2. Explore the visualizations to gain insights.
3. Use the dataset for your own analysis or extend the visualizations as needed.

## Future Scope
- Integrate machine learning models to predict accident-prone areas.
- Include geospatial analysis to map accidents across cities.
- Automate data updates with newer datasets.
